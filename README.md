# The Gaming State

### Website for reviewing games
Inspired by Album of The Year website where a lot of people review new albums and songs, and since IGDB has a free API for getting games, but has almost no reviews, and multiple platforms have a prise for the GOTY (Game Awards, Steam, etc...) every year, I think it would be nice to have a website like that for the gaming community to have fun choosing and reviewing their favorite games.
